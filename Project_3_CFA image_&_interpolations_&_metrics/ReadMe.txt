In this project we deal with a representation called 'CFA image', which is basecaly a 2D grid in gray level. 
We apply different interpolation methodes to go from a gray level image to an RGB colored image  (3D matrix)
The functions metrics in this project helps us to determine wether the accuracy of the interpolation methode.
