The main object of this project is image classification.

To achieave this goal, we approche the probleme by deploying a Deep Learning model called ResNet-50 for feature extraction.
To classify the features, we apply a Machine Learning Classifier called SVM.
The project uses a GUI application made with GUIDE in Matlab.

IMPORTANT NOTE: in order for the app to work properly, we need to put a file called 'classifier.mat' in the same directory as the other files of the project (GUI_app.m and GUI_app.fig)
the link to this file 'classifier.mat' via my Drive(the file exceeds 25 MO):
